# opendis7-java Library

This project provides a complete type-safe open-source Java implementation of the IEEE Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) Protocol.

Now available: [latest release] autogenerated using GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration / Continuous Development (CI/CD).

Current support includes IEEE DIS Protocol version 7 (IEEE 1278.1-2012) 
and Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization SISO-REF-010 Enumerations specifications.
The majority of source code is autogenerated by the
[opendis7-source-generator](https://github.com/open-dis/opendis7-source-generator) project.
Also available:
* [opendis7-java Distribution Products](https://savage.nps.edu/opendis7-java) which includes
* [opendis7-full.jar](https://savage.nps.edu/opendis7-java/opendis7-full.jar) collecting various subset jar files in a single "fat jar",
* [opendis7 Javadoc](https://savage.nps.edu/open-dis7-java/javadoc) combined documentation for all PDU and enumeration classes,
* [DIS XML Schema](https://savage.nps.edu/opendis7-java/xml/DIS_7_2012.autogenerated.xsd) and [DIS XML Schema documentation](https://savage.nps.edu/opendis7-java/xml/SchemaDocumentation).

Additional example programs and resources are found in the NPS MOVES
[Networked Graphics MV3500](https://gitlab.nps.edu/Savage/NetworkedGraphicsMV3500) course.
Recent project products include DIS stream-handling support.
